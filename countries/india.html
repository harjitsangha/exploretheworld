<h3 class="type1h3">India</h3>
<p class="type1p">India, officially the Republic of India (Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[e] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose.Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; the later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture.</p>

<h3 class="type2h3">Etymology</h3>
<p class="type2p">The name India is derived from Indus, which originates from the Old Persian word Hindu.[19] The latter term stems from the Sanskrit word Sindhu, which was the historical local appellation for the Indus River.[20] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as "The people of the Indus".[21]

The geographical term Bharat (Bhārat, pronounced [ˈbʱaːrət̪] (About this sound listen)), which is recognised by the Constitution of India as an official name for the country,[22] is used by many Indian languages in its variations. It is a modernisation of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which traditionally referred to the Indian subcontinent and gained increasing currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[23][24] Scholars believe it to be named after the Vedic tribe of Bhāratas in the second millennium BCE.[25] It is also traditionally associated with the rule of the legendary emperor Bharata.Hindustanis a Persian name for India dating back to the 3rd century BCE. It was introduced into India by the Mughals and widely used since then. Its meaning varied, referring to a region that encompassed northern India and Pakistan or India in its entirety

<h3 class="type1h3">History</h3>
<p class="type1p">The earliest authenticated human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[31] Nearly contemporaneous Mesolithic rock art sites have been found in many parts of the Indian subcontinent, including at the Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh.[32] Around 7000 BCE, the first known Neolithic settlements appeared on the subcontinent in Mehrgarh and other sites in western Pakistan.[33] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[34] the first urban culture in South Asia;[35] it flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[36] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[35]

During the period 2000–500 BCE, in terms of culture, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age.[37] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[38] were composed during this period,[39] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[37] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent.</p>

<h3 class="type2h3">Politics</h3>
<p class="type2p">India is the world's most populous democracy.[155] A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[156] it has seven recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40 regional parties.[157] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[158] and the BJP right-wing.[159][160][161] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[162] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions at the centre.[163]

In the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971.</p>

<h3 class="type1h3">Culture</h3>
<p class="type1p">Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[288] During the Vedic period (c. 1700 – 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[21] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.[289] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[290] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[289] and by Buddhist philosophy.Much of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[292] Vernacular architecture is also highly regional in it flavours. Vastu shastra, literally "science of construction" or "architecture" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[293] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[294] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs</p>
